# Student Management System - README
  
## Project Planning
### 1. Project Scope and Objectives

#### Project Objectives: ==Learning and Showcase==

#### Project Scope

This project is designed to strike a balance between personal learning and showcasing skills in software development. It involves the creation of a software application while emphasizing the learning process and creating a polished portfolio piece.


### Learning and Skill Development (Objective 1)

- **Primary Goal:** Acquire new knowledge and skills.
- **Approach:** Emphasize learning by experimenting with new technologies, languages, and advanced coding techniques.
- **Priority:** Gaining experience and insights is the primary focus over project complexity.

### Showcasing Skills and Portfolio (Objective 3)

- **Primary Goal:** Create a polished showcase for the portfolio.
- **Approach:** Ensure the project is well-documented, organized, and visually appealing.
- **Focus:** Highlight skills, creativity, and attention to detail in the final product.

#### Project Duration

The project is expected to be completed within a one-week timeframe, balancing learning and skill demonstration efficiently.

### Documentation

Project documentation will include details of the learning process, challenges encountered, and solutions, making it a valuable reference for future learning and showcasing growth as a developer.

### 2. Requirements Gathering
- List down the core requirements of the system. These might include student data management, basic user authentication, and basic file I/O.
- Be realistic about what can be achieved within a week. Avoid overcomplicating the project with too many features.
    Certainly, here's a list of core requirements for your Student Management System:

1. **Student Data Management:**
   - The system must allow users to add, update, and delete student records.
   - Each student record should include essential information such as name, roll number, age, and grade.

2. **Data Persistence:**
   - Student data should be saved to a file to ensure that records are retained between program executions.

3. **View Student List:**
   - Users should be able to view a list of all student records, displaying relevant details for each student.

4. **Search Functionality:**
   - The system should provide a search feature to find a student's record based on their roll number.

5. **User Authentication (Optional):**
   - Implement basic user authentication to differentiate between administrators and regular users. This feature can be skipped if not required.

6. **Grading System (Optional):**
   - Optionally, add a grading system that calculates and assigns grades to students based on their scores or performance.

7. **Sorting and Statistics (Optional):**
   - Provide the option to sort the student list by various criteria (e.g., name, roll number, grade).
   - Calculate and display statistics such as the average age and average grade of all students.

8. **Class Management (Optional):**
   - Organize students into classes or courses, allowing for separate management and reporting for each class.

9. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement error handling to ensure the system gracefully handles unexpected situations, such as file I/O errors or invalid inputs.

10. **Documentation:**
    - Create comprehensive documentation, including a user manual, code comments, and README file on GitHub.

### 3. Task Prioritization
- Identify critical tasks for a functional system. Prioritize tasks such as adding students, viewing students, and saving data.

### 4. Project Plan
- Create a simplified project plan with a clear one-week timeline.
- Break down the week into days and allocate specific tasks to each day.
- Reserve time for testing, bug fixing, and documentation at the end of the week.
